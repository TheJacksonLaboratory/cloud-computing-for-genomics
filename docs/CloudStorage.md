# Cloud Storage
I will mostly be discussing about cloud storage w.r.t GCP.

## Introduction
Cloud storage is a subcategory of cloud computing. Cloud storage refers to storage service model in which data is transmitted and stored on remote storage systems, where it is maintained, managed, backed up and made available to users over a network. Cloud computing systems offer users access to not only storage, but also processing power and computer applications installed on a remote network. The storage concept utilizes instant elasticity, scalability, multi-tenacy and storage infrastructure which provides accessible interface and virtualization. This means that cloud-based storage services have the capability of increasing or decreasing based on need and users generally pay according to the storage consumtion and the tier of storage being utilized.

At its most basic level, a cloud storage system needs just one data server connected to the Internet. A user can send files over the Internet to the data server, which then records the information. When the client wishes to retrieve the information, he or she accesses the data server through a Web-based interface. The server then either sends the files back to the client or allows the client to access and manipulate the files on the server itself.

Cloud storage systems generally rely on hundreds of data servers. Because computers occasionally require maintenance or repair, it's important to store the same information on multiple machines. This is called redundancy. Without redundancy, a cloud storage system couldn't ensure clients that they could access their information at any given time. Most systems store the same data on servers that use different power supplies. That way, clients can access their data even if one power supply fails. 

## How storage works
Large data centers are maintained in multiple locations around the world. When customers purchase cloud storage from a provider, they turn over most aspects of the data storage to the vendor, including security, capacity, storage servers and computing resources, data availability and delivery over a network. Customer applications can access the stored cloud data through traditional storage protocols or application programming indicators (APIs), or they can also be moved to the cloud.

The most important features of cloud storage working are its reliability and security. The data being stored on the cloud storage buckets is encypted on the server side, before data is written to the disk, using AES-256. Furthermore, the encryted data is maintained/accessed through encryption keys.
