# Cloud Computing in Life Sciences
Biomedical/Life science industries are accustomed to working with large complex datasets. Accordingly, in most cases intensive compuitng resources are required to decipher coded signals. Additionally, analyzing the datasets efficiently and securely storing the data during adds to the complexity. The current method of doing this is in on-prem clster, separate systems or silos. An effective way of making the data more accessible is by employing cloud-based platforms for storing data and executing analysis. This allows processes to be accelerated by inhibiting the resource bottlenecks and generation of global knowledge-sharing.

## What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to easily accessible on-demand computer system resource that mainly provides services for data storage and processing power. It is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include, but are not limited to, tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed and utilized is found remotely in the cloud or a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. This means the user is not required to be in a specific place to gain access to it, allowing the user to work remotely. Cloud computing takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.

## Why Cloud Computing
There are a number of reasons why accessing a remote machine is invaluable to any scientists working with large datasets. In the early history of computing, working on a remote machine was standard practice - computers were bulky and expensive. Today we work on laptops or desktops that are more powerful than the sum of the world’s computing capacity 20 years ago, but many analyses (especially in genomics) are too large to run on these laptops/desktops. These analyses require larger machines, often several of them linked together, where remote access is the only practical solution.
In recent years, the advancement in computational power has become a commodity and companies are basing their business models around employing the strategy of acquirung one or more linked computational resources for as long as you required, at relatively low cost. That also happens to be the basic principle behind the cloud. You define your computational requirements based on tasks at hane and acquire resources accordingly for the duration of your task.

## When Cloud Computing
There are mahny reasons why researchers and computationally demanding task are migrating towards incresed utilization of cloud computing.
1. Your computer/cluster does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth).
2. Your computer is taking hours or days to get through an analysis.
3. The scheduler keeps putting your jobs into queue becuase of number of jobs schedules and the resource allocation your particular job demands.
4. You have collaborators outside of your company/institute. It just easier to collaborate through cloud.
5. You expect your data to keep growing and want the data to be stored in databases or if you intend to have your final product facing the public internet.
6. You cannot install software on your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, conflicts with other existing applications, etc.)
7. You cannot afford the infrastructure (hardware, bandwidth, power supply, administrator) required to acquire and maintain sufficiently large computers for your analysis.
8. Reduce costs and help users focus on their business needs instead of being blocked by IT challenges.
