# Cloud Computing in Life Sciences

Biomedical/Life science industries are accustomed to working with large complex datasets. Accordingly, in most cases intensive compuitng resources are required to decipher coded signals. Additionally, analyzing the datasets efficiently and securely storing the data during adds to the complexity. The current method of doing this is in on-prem clster, separate systems or silos. An effective way of making the data more accessible is by employing cloud-based platforms for storing data and executing analysis. This allows processes to be accelerated by inhibiting the resource bottlenecks and generation of global knowledge-sharing.

This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons.
